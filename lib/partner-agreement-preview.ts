    <li>This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship beyond what is necessary to market Listings and collect/settle payments.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Shettar’s obligations</h2>
  <p>Subject to this Agreement, Shettar will use reasonable efforts to:</p>

    <li>Shettar’s aggregate liability arising out of this Agreement in any 12-month period is limited to the total Fees actually retained by Shettar from the Partner’s Bookings in that period (or ₦<strong>[CAP AMOUNT]</strong>, whichever is higher), except for liability that cannot be limited by law (including fraud).</li>
    <li>The Partner will indemnify Shettar against claims arising from the Partner’s Property, Listing content, Guest stays, tax failures, or breach of this Agreement, except to the extent caused by Shettar’s wilful misconduct.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>15. Changes</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Shettar may update Platform features and policies from time to time.</li>
    <li>Material changes to Fees or this Agreement will be notified via the Business portal and/or email. Continued use after the effective date of a notified change constitutes acceptance, unless the Partner terminates under Section 12.</li>

    <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any clause is unenforceable, the remainder continues in force.</li>
    <li><strong>Governing law and disputes.</strong> Nigerian law applies. The Parties will first attempt good-faith negotiation; failing that, the courts of Nigeria that have competent jurisdiction over the dispute shall hear the matter.</li>
